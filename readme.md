## Introduction
Welcome to the M65 Freezer readme!  

The M65 Freezer application is designed to be used as the MEGA65 Freezer utility.  The utility is launched when the machine is "frozen" (a-la the "freezer carts").

This is a new version of the Freezer application now using the Karl Jr. and Jude libraries for its interface.

Development is still in progress but some of the features are fully implemented.

## License
The M65 Freezer, Karl Jr. and Jude modules are released under the terms of the LGPL.
